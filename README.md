In order to run the above code, you have to make a "Public" folder inside server folder.
You also need to set the sever's "FIRST_PATH" to the absolute path of server on you're machine.
It also only works on Linux. if you want to run on windows, you have to change all the '/' to '\\' :)
good luck! :D
